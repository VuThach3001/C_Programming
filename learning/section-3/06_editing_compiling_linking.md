**1. Overview**
- There are four fundamental tasks in the creation of any C program
  - Editing
  - Compiling
  - Linking
  - Executing
- These tasks will become second nature to you because you will be doing it so often.
- The processes of editing, compiling, linking and executing are essentially the same for developing programs in any environment and with any compiled language.

**2.Editing:** 
- It is the process of creating and modifying your C source code
  - **Source code** is inside a file and contains the program instructions you write.
  - Choose a wise name for your base file name (all source files end in the .c extension)
  - We will use an IDE (code blocks) for this class, but, you can use any editor (notepad, etc) to create your source code.

**3. Compiling**
- A compiler converts your code into machine language and detects and reports errors in your code.
  - The input to the compiler is the file you produce during your editing (source file).
- Compilation is a two-stage process
  - The first stage is called the preprocessing phase, during which your code may be modified or added to.
  - The second stage is the actual compilation that generates the object code.
- The compiler examines each program statement and checks it to ensure that it conforms to the syntax and semantics of the language
  - It can also recognize structural errors (dead code).
  - It does not find logic errors.
  - Typical errors reported might be due to an expression that has unbalanced parentheses (syntactic error), or due to the use of a variable that is not "defined" (semantic error)
- After all errors are fixed, the compiler will then take each statement of the program and translate it into assembly language
- The compiler will then translate the assembly language statements into actual machine instructions
  - The output from the compiler is known as **object code** and it is stored in files called **object files** (same name as source file with a .obj or .o extension)
- The standard command to compile your C programs will be cc (or the GNU compiler, which is .gcc)
  - cc -c myprog.c or gcc -c mypro.c
  - If you omit the -c flag, your program will automatically be linked as well.

**4. Linking**
- After the program has been translated into object code, it is ready to be linked
  - The purpose of the linking phase is to get the program into a final form for execution on the computer.
  - Linking usually occurs automatically when compiling depending on what system you are on, but, can sometimes be a separate command.
- The linker combines the object modules generated by the compiler with additional libraries needed by the program to create the whole executable
  - Also detects and reports errors
    - If part of your program is missing or a nonexistent library component is referenced.
- Program libraries support and extend the C language by providing routines to carry out operations that are not part of the language
  - Input and Output libraries mathematical libraries, string manipulation libraries
- A failure during the linking phase means that once again you have to go back and edit your source code
- Success will produce an executable file
  - In a Windows environment, the executable file will have an .exe extension.
  - In UNIX/Linux, there will be no such extension (a.out by default).
  - Many IDEs have a build option, which will compile and link your program in a single operation to produce the executable
- The program is much easier to manage by breaking it up into a number of smaller source files
  - It is cohesive and makes the development and maintenance of the program a lot easier.
  - The set of source files that make up the program will usually be integrated under a project name, which is used to refer to the whole program.

**5. Executing**
- In most IDEs, you'll find an appropriate menu command that allows you to run or execute your compiled program
  - Otherwise double click the .exe file or type a.out on the console in Linux manually
- The execution stage is where you run your program
  - Ech of the statements of the program is sequentially executed in turn
  - If the program requests any data from the user the program temporarily suspends its execution so that the input can be entered.
  - Results that are displayed by the program (output) appear in a window called the console
- This stage can also generate a wide variety of error conditions
  - Producing the wrong output
  - Just sitting there and doing nothing
  - Crashing your computer
- If the program does not perform the intended functionality then it will be necessary to go back and reanalyze the program's logic
  - Known as the debugging phase, correct all the known problems or bugs from the program
  - Will need to make changes to the original source program
  - The entire process of compiling, linking and executing the program must be repeated until the desired results are obtained.
