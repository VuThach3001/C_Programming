### Cue Column (Questions, Keywords, or Prompts)

**1. Overview**
- Another unique feature of the C language that is not found in many other higher-level programming languages.
- It allows for programs to be easier to develop, easier to read, easier to modify, and easier to port to different computer systems.
- Part of the C compilation process that recognizes special statements.
    - Analyzes these statements before analysis of the C program itself takes place.
    - An instruction to your compiler to do something before compiling the source code
    - Could be anywhere in your code.
- Preprocessor statements are identified by the presence of a pound sign, ```#```, which must be the first non-space character on the line, which is also known as **preprocessor directive**
- We will utilize the preprocessor to:
    - Create are own constants and macros with the ```#define``` statement.
    - Build our own library files with the ```#include``` statement.
    - Make more powerful programs with the conditional ```#ifdef```, ```#endif```, ```#else```, and ```#ifndef``` statements.
- We will cover the above in future lectures.
