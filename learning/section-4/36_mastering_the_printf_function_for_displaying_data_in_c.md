### Cue Column (Questions, Keywords, or Prompts)

**1. OVerview**
- In the first challenge, there was a line of code that included the word ```printf```
- ```printf("Hi, my name is Jason");```
- It is a standard library function
    - It outputs information to the command line (the standard output stream, which is the command line by default)
    - The information displayed is in based on what appears between the parentheses that immediately follow the function name ```printf```
    - Also notice that this line does **end with a semicolon**

**2. Printf Function**
- Probably the most common function used in C
- Provides an easy and convenient means to display program results.
- Not only can simple phrases be displayed, but the values of variables and the results of computations can also be displayed.
    - It can be used for **debugging**
