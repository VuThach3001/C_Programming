**1. Overview**
- An **arithmetic** operator is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on them
- A **logical operator** (sometimes called a **Boolean operator**) is an operator that returns a **Boolean** result that's based on the **Boolean** result of one or two other expressions.
- **Assignment operators** set variables equal to values
    - Assigns the value of the expression at its right to the variable at its left
- A **relational operator** will compare variables against each other.

**Note**: 

For the ```++``` is the special **operator** which has the specific usage when it is put in the front or behind the variable.
- ```++a```: which means this will increase the value assigned to this variable first then execute the statement.
- ```a++```: which means this will increase the value assigned to this variable after executing the statement.

And this is the same for ```--```
