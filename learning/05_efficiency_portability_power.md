### Notes Section (Main Notes)

**1. Overview**
- C produces compact and efficient programs.
- C is one of the most important programming languages and will continue to be so.
- The main features of C are the following:
  - Efficient
  - Portable
  - Powerful and Flexible
  - Programmer Oriented.

**2. Efficiency and Portability**
- C is an efficient language
  - It takes advantage of the capabilities of current computers.
  - C programs are compact and fast (similar to assembly language programs)
  - Programmers can fine-tune their programs for maximum speed or most efficient use of memory.
- C is a portable language
  - C programs written on one system can be run on other systems with little or no modification.
  - c is a leader in portability.
  - Compilers are available for many computer architectures.
- Linux/Unix systems typically come with a C compiler as part of the package
  - Compilers are available for personal computers.
- A good chance that you can get a C compiler for whatever device you are using

**3. Power and Flexibility**
- The Unix/Linux kernel is written in C
- Many compilers and interpreters for other languages (FORTRAN, Perl, Python, Pascal, LISP, Logo, and BASIC) have been written in C
- C programs have been used for solving physics and engineering problems and even for animating special effects for movies.
- C is flexible
  - It is used for developing just about everything you can imagine by way of a computer program
  - It accounts applications to word processing and from games to operating systems.
  - It is the basis for more advanced languages, such as C++
- It is also used for developing mobile phone apps in the form of Objective C (a proprietary language by Apple)
- C is easy to learn because of its compactness
  - C is an ideal first language to learn if you want to be a programmer.
  - You will acquire sufficient knowledge for practical application development quickly and easily.

**4. Programmer Oriented**
- C fulfills the needs of programmers
  - It gives you access to hardware
  - It enables you to manipulate individual bits in memory
- C contains a large selection of operators which allows you to express yourself succinctly.
- C is less strict than most languages in limiting what you can do
  - Can be both an advantage and a danger
  
    **Advantage:**
    - Many tasks (such as converting forms of data) are easier in C.
    
    **Danger:**
    - You can make mistakes (pointers) that are impossible in some languages.
  - C gives you more freedom, but it also puts more responsibility on you.
- C implementations have a large library of useful C functions
  - Deal with common needs of most programmers

**5. Other Features**
- C provides low level features that are generally provided by the Lower Level Languages
- Programs can be manipulated using bits
  - Ability to manage memory representation at bit level
  - Provides wide variety of bit manipulation operators
- Pointers play a big role in C
  - It directly accesses to memory
  - It supports efficient use of pointers

**Disadvantages**
- Flexibility and freedom also requires added responsibility
  - The uses of pointers is problematic and abused.
  - You can make programming errors that are difficult to trace.
- Sometimes because of its wealth of operators and its conciseness, it makes the language difficult to read and follow
  - There is an opportunity to write obscure code.
