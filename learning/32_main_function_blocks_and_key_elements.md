 - Just some highlight of the previous lecture
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Hi, my name is Thach\n");
    return 0;
}
```
- ```main()```: going with two parentheses that are signifying that it's a function. 
   - Basically, a function contains code inside of it.
   - Main function is part of all C programs that is antry point to the program and get invoked when you execute the program.
- ```{}```: Squiggy brackets define the starting and ending of the function. These can be referred as the block of the code

**Note**: Whether you use the uppercase or lowercase, it's going to make a difference.
- If you change from ```int``` into ```Int```, it's not going to compile as it's an error.
- All the statements must end in a semicolon ```;```.

**Note**: The use of indentation spacing new lines in meaningful names will make your code more readable.
