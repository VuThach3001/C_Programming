**Logic Errors**
- Errors or bugs in your code that cause your program to run incorrectly
- Logic errors are mistakes made by the programmer

- Suppose we have a program that determines if a person can vote in an election and you must be 18 years or older to vote.
```
if (age > 18){
   ..."Yes, you can vote!";
}
```
- We need to test our code.
