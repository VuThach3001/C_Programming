**1. Overview**
- C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language that supports structured programming.
- Uses statements that change a program's state, focuses on how.
- Currently, it is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time.
- C is a modern language
  - It has most basic control structures and features of modern languages.
  - It is designed for top-down planning.
  - It is organized around the use of functions (modular design) structured programming.
  - It is a very reliable and readable program.
- C is used on everything from minicomputers, Unix/Linux systems to PC's and mainframes.
- C is the preferred language for producing word processing programs, spreadsheets and compilers.
- C has become popular for programming embedded systems
  - It is used to program microprocessors found in automobiles, cameras, DVD players, etc.
- C has and continues to play a strong role in the development of Linux.
- C programs are very easy to modify and easy to adapt to new models or languages.
- In the 1990s, many software houses began turning to the C++ language for large programming projects.
- C is a subset of C++ with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) programming tools added
  - Any C program is a valid C++ program.
  - By learning C, you also learn much of C++.
- C remains a core skill needed by corporations and ranks in the top 10 of desired skills.
- C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and thus is used by programs that were previously implement in assembly language
  - Provides low-level access to memory (has many low-level capabilities)
  - Requires minimal run-time support.

**2. History**
- C was invented in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories
  - Ritchie was working on the design of the UNIX operating system
- C was created as a tool for working programmers
  - Main goal is to be a useful language
  - Easy readability and writability.
- C initially became widely known as the development language of the UNIX operating system.
  - Virtually all new major operating systems are written in C and/or C++
- C evolved from a previous programming language named B
  - Uses many of the important concepts of B while adding data typing and other powerful features.
  - B was a "typeless" language - every data item occupied one "word" in memory, and the burden of typing variables fell on the shoulders of the programmers.
- C is available for most computers.
- C is also hardware independent.
- By the late 1970s, C has evolved into what is now referred to as "traditional C".
- The rapid expansion of C working on many different hardware platforms led to many variations that were similar but often incompatible.
  - A standard version of C was created (C89/C90, C99, C11).
- A program written only in **Standard C** and without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any platform with a standard C compiler.
  - Non-standard C programs may run only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler.
- C89 is supported by current C compilers
  - Most C code being written today is based on it.
- C99 is a revised standard for the C programming language that refines and expands the capabilities of C
  - It has not been widely adopted and not all popular C compilers support it.
- C11 is the current standard and commonly used.
  - Some elements of the language as defined by C11 are optional.
  - It is also impossible that a C11 compiler may not implement all of the language features mandated by the C11 standard.
  - This class will base its examples and concepts off C11.
- C is one of the most important and popular programming languages.
- It has grown because people try it and like it.
- In the past decade or tow, many have moved from C languages such as C++, Objective C, and Java
  - C is still an important language in its own right, as well a migration path to these others.
